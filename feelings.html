            Yo, It's been a while. I hope you have been good. It's been a bit weird not talking to you for a while. I have been good though don't worry much okay.<br>As you can see I have picked up somewhat of a new skill that I plan to expand on. I'd appreciate if you look around and tell me what you think of this website and its pages.
        </p>

            <strong>You can choose to skip this if you want. I hope you don't though.</strong>
            <br><br>It's been somewhat fun working on this little projects. I actually started this project last night but the gaddamn power went out so I had to finish it this morning.<br>To tell you the truth I'm far from being a professional at this. Most of this, if not everything I had help from AI although I wrote every code by hand. It wasn't easy I'll tell you and tbh I'm not even sure if all the buttons and pages will work. I've tested it and it seems alright but you never know.
            <br><br>
            This is already becoming a long read so i think I'll end here. I hope to get a review from you. Have a nice day
